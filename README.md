# Lumen-Influence-Dataset
This dataset contains different types of texts from multiple sources labeled for the presence of several influence cues, and split into three groups: 
1. Deceptive Texts (containing disinformation and/or deception tactics)
2. Hyperpartisan News (from politically right- and left-leaning publications)
3. Mainstream News (containing center mainstream media news)

At this stage, we kindly ask that this dataset not be distributed or disseminated to others.
